      <h1> Code the Dream </h1>
      <p> I am excited about learning Web Development and JavaScript.
          It is a blessing to be part of this school and have Mentors and Students helping you along the way.
          Being able to be part of such a diverse group will be exciting as well. Begining my path as a
          Web Developer is the best thing that happened to me recently. I look forward to learn and code every day.</p>
